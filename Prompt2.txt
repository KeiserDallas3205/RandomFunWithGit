It's a beautiful day on Louisiana Tech's campus. 
The sun is shining and the birds are singing. 
All of a sudden, the ground starts shaking and a giant monster appears! It's Godzilla! 
The students start running in all directions, screaming in terror. 
Some hide under desks, others try to run away. 
Godzilla starts destroying everything in sight, buildings crumble and cars are crushed. 
The students are all terrified, but there's nowhere to go. 
Godzilla is on a rampage and there's nothing anyone can do to stop him!
A couple of people tried to make a run for the student center, but were 
trampled on the seal.
